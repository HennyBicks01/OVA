She loved naps in sunbeams, naps in boxes, naps under blankets.  One sunny afternoon, Emmy was napping in a big, fluffy basket.  Suddenly, a tiny, chirping sound woke her up.  A little bird had gotten stuck in a bush outside the window!  Emmy, who wasn't usually brave, felt a little tickle of something...helpfulness?  She tiptoed to the window and watched the little bird.  It looked so scared and tiny! Emmy, remembering all the soft blankets she loved, gently nudged a pillow toward the bush.  The bird hopped onto the pillow, and Emmy nudged it closer and closer to the window.  Finally, the bird hopped out!  Emmy purred with happiness.  She'd helped a friend!  She snuggled back in her basket, feeling super proud."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are you doing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm listening and helping!
